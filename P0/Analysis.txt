Run Time Analysis 


1. Task0 has a worst-case time-complexity of 2;
    There are two variables each of O(1).
    Hence,The overall worst-case notation of this code is O(1).

2. Task1 has a worst-case time-complexity of 4n + 2;
    There are four for loops each of O(n) and 2 variables each of O(1)
    Hence,The overall worst-case notation of this code is 4O(n) + 2O(1).

3. Task2 has a worst-case time-complexity of 2n + 1;
    There are two for loops each of O(n), one sorting on O(n) and 2 variables each of O(1)
    Hence,The overall worst-case notation of this code is 3O(n) + 2O(1).

4. Task3 has a worst-case time-complexity of 5n + 3;
    There are four for loops each of O(n),  and 3 variables each of O(1)
    Hence,The overall worst-case notation of this code is 5O(n) + 3O(1).

5. Task4 has a worst-case time-complexity of n^2 + 4n.
    There are four for loops each of O(n) and a list comprehension of O(n^2) 
    Hence,The overall worst-case notation of this code is 5O(n).
